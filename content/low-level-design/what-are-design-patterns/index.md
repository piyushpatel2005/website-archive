Design patterns are reusable proven solutions to commonly occuring problems. In software industry, there are several use cases which require a specific kind of solution to make your software code be more maintainable and reusable. Design patterns provide a general way of organizing code such that it solves specific problem

Design patterns also provide common language for communication with your colleagues and other developers. There are three main categories of Design patterns.

1. Creational Patterns: deals with object creation
2. Structural Patterns: focus on how to organize classes and objects to make the code more flexible and reusable.
3. Behavioral Patterns: focus on collaboration between different objects in a software system.

Each of these categories include several different patterns mentioned below.

## 1. Creational Design Patterns

- Factory Method Pattern: This provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but actual class is created based on derived subclasses.
- Abstract Factory Pattern:
- Singleton Pattern: This pattern is also widely used for creating only one instance of an object. This object then will be available globally for relevant use.
- Builder Pattern: This is widely used to create objects with additional properties or options. We can configure the actual final object by method chaining to add new options.
- Prototype Pattern: This pattern is used to copy existing objects without strong coupling with the original classes.

## 2. Structural Design Patterns

- Adapter Pattern
- Bridge Pattern
- Composite Pattern
- Decorator Pattern
- Facade Pattern
- Flyweight Pattern
- Proxy Pattern

## 3. Behavioral Design Patterns

- Chain of Responsibility
- Command Pattern
- Iterator Pattern
- Mediator Pattern
- Memento Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- State Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
- Template Method Pattern
- Visitor Pattern
