This lesson focuses on the objective of High level system design, what it covers and how it is assessing you as a candidate.

<!--more-->

High level System design or System design interview in general is one of the most important interviews these days. These interviews start with an interviewer providing you a short and purposefully vague system that you need to design.

These interviews are used to test your depth of knowledge in designing a particular system as well as your ability to communicate these designs to other engineers. These interviews are used critically to determine your level of seniority. So, these interviews are sometimes rated higher than other types of interviews for senior positions. These interviews can be very challenging especially because you have to design a complex system within an hour. The complexity is even more because you might have to think, draw and talk at the same time to your interviewer. System design is more of an art because you have to think of a design in the given constraints like resources, time to suit your current and future requirements.

## It's a tradeoff

System design discussion is more about one's ability to discuss multiple possible approaches and weight their advantages and disadvantages for the given problem. The interviewer is looking for your ability to clearly communicate your thoughts and ideas. They are also not looking for perfect solution but it's more about how you can convince them to a particular solution. So, having knowledge of various technologies and their tradeoffs is essential for this interview.
