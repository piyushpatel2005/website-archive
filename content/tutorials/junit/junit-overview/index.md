JUnit is a popular open-source testing framework for Java applications. It provides a simple and easy-to-use platform for writing and executing automated tests.

## Why do we need JUnit?

First of all, let's understand why we need automated testing frameworks like JUnit. Here are some reasons why you should use an automated unit testing frameworks for testing.

1. Automated unit tests allow you to catch bugs early in the development cycle. By writing tests that verify the desired behavior of individual units of code, you can quickly identify issues and fix them before they propagate into other parts of your system.

2. Unit testing leads to better code design and encourages modularization, loose coupling, and good software architecture practices. Automated unit testing helps improve overall code quality.

3. As your codebase grows and evolves, it's essential to ensure that new changes don't break existing functionality. With automated unit tests, you can run them whenever you make modifications or add new features to validate that everything still works as expected throughout the development process.

4. Automated unit testing plays a crucial role in CI/CD pipelines by enabling continuous integration and delivery processes. With each commit or pull request, units tests are executed automatically to check for any issues introduced by the changes.

5. Unit tests act as living documentation for your codebase. When written with clear naming conventions and well-defined test cases, they serve as examples for how your code should be used and what output is expected in various scenarios.

## History of JUnit

JUnit was originally created by Kent Beck and Erich Gamma in 1997 as an extension to the existing SUnit (Smalltalk Unit Testing Framework). It quickly gained popularity due to its simplicity and effectiveness in automating unit tests for Java code.

The current version of JUnit is JUnit 5, which was released in September 2017. This major update introduced several new features and improvements over the previous versions.

## Features of JUnit

1. Built-in Annotations: JUnit uses annotations to define test methods, setup/teardown methods, and more. These annotations provide metadata about how each method should be treated during the test execution process.
2. Assertions: JUnit also provides a set of assert methods that allow developers to check expected results against actual results. These methods include assertions like `assertEquals()`, `assertTrue()`, `assertFalse()`, etc.
3. Test Lifecycle Hooks: JUnit 5 introduced lifecycle hooks such as `@BeforeEach` and `@AfterEach` that allow developers to specify setup and teardown actions for each individual test case. This way we can customize the behavior of tests.
4. Parameterized Tests: With JUnit 5, it became possible to write parameterized tests where you can run the same test logic multiple times with different input values.
5. Test Suites: You can group related test cases into test suites using JUnit. This allows you to execute multiple tests together as a single unit and enables better test organization.
6. Extensions: JUnit 5 introduced a powerful extension model that allows developers to extend the functionality of tests using custom extensions. This enables customizations specific to your project's needs.

## What is JUnit 5?

The JUnit 5 framework is composed of several components that work together to provide a comprehensive testing solution. The main components of JUnit 5 are as follows.

1. **JUnit Platform:** The JUnit Platform serves as the foundation for running tests on different platforms, such as the JVM, Android, and even in the browser. It provides an API for launching test frameworks and discovering tests.
2. **JUnit Jupiter:** JUnit Jupiter is the new programming model for writing tests in JUnit 5. It includes annotations like `@Test`, `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`, etc., which help in writing clean and expressive tests. Jupiter also introduces new features like parameterized tests, nested tests, dynamic tests, and more.
3. **JUnit Vintage:** JUnit Vintage provides backward compatibility with earlier versions of JUnit, specifically targeting JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 tests. It allows you to run existing legacy tests written in JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 without having to migrate them to the new Jupiter programming model.
