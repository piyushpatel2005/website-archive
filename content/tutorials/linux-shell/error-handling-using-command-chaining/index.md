Linux Bash scripting offers a robust environment for automating tasks and creating powerful scripts. However, like any programming language, error handling is a critical aspect that ensures the reliability and stability of your scripts. In this lesson, we will explore various mechanisms for effectively handling errors in Linux Bash scripting.

## Error Handling in Linux Bash Scripting:

### 1. Exit Codes:
One common method of error handling involves the use of exit codes. Exit codes provide information about the execution status of a command or script. By convention, an exit code of 0 indicates success, while any other non-zero value signifies an error. To handle error situation, we can perform following items.

1. Checking Exit Codes: You can check the exit code after executing a command using the `$?` variable and take appropriate actions based on its value.

2. Conditional Statements: Utilize conditional statements like `if`, `else`, and `elif` to perform specific operations or display custom messages based on exit codes.

3. Echo Errors: Use the `echo` command to display custom error messages when specific conditions are not met or when an unexpected situation arises. Clear and informative error messages are essential for troubleshooting issues within your scripts. Providing meaningful errors helps identify problems quickly and facilitates debugging processes.

4. Logging Errors: Redirect error messages to log files using the `>>` operator or tools like `logger`. This allows for easier analysis of errors at a later stage.

5. Function Wrappers: Wrap potential problematic code within functions and call them inside conditional statements controlled by error checking mechanisms.


## Error Handling Using Command Chaining:

In Linux Bash scripting, command chaining allows us to execute multiple commands in sequence with certain conditions for error handling. Here are two common techniques for error handling using command chaining:

### 1. The `&&` Operator:
The `&&` operator ensures that the subsequent process is only executed if the previous one completes successfully (exit code 0). If an error occurs at any point, the subsequent commands are skipped, saving unnecessary execution time. Below is hypothetical scenario where we have three functions defined with names `get_files`, `extract_files` and `rename_files`. We want to execute them sequentially and if preceding function fails, we do not want to execute the next one.

```bash
get_files && gzip_files && rename
```

### 2. The `||` Operator:
The `||` operator works in an inverse manner compared to the `&&` operator. It executes the next command only if its preceding command fails (non-zero exit code). This technique is commonly used for fallback or alternative actions. Below code is just a pseudo code where we may have a function to bring files locally and we can try two servers.

```bash
get_file_from_server() {
    server=$1
    wget ${server}/filename -O /tmp/
}
get_file_from_server host1 || get_file_from_server host2
```

Implementing effective error handling mechanisms greatly enhances the robustness and reliability of your Linux Bash scripts. By utilizing exit codes, informative error messages, try-catch-like techniques, and command chaining, you can gracefully handle errors and streamline your automation processes.
