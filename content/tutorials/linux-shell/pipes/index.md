Linux pipes are a powerful feature that allow you to connect multiple commands together, enabling efficient and flexible data processing on the command line. These fatures help enhance your productivity and streamline your workflow.

In this blog post, we will explore the ins and outs of Linux pipes, learn how they work, and discover some practical examples of their usage.

## What is a Linux Pipe?

A Linux pipe is a form of inter-process communication that allows to take the output from one command and use it as input for another command. This creates a continuous flow of data between commands, enabling them to work together seamlessly.

When you use a pipe in Linux, the output from the preceding command is fed directly into the input of the following command. This allows you to perform complex operations by chaining together simple commands. The data flows through the pipe in a stream-like fashion, allowing for real-time processing.

## Syntax for Using Pipes

Using a pipe in Linux is simple. You just need to use the `|` symbol between two commands. Here's an example:

```bash { lineNos=false }
command1 | command2
```

In this syntax, the output of `command1` will be passed as input to `command2`. You can chain together as many commands as you need to accomplish your desired tasks.

## Additional Bash Commands

### `wc`: Count words, bytes and lines

- Syntax: `wc [options] [file]`
- Usage: The `wc` command is used to count the number of lines, words, and bytes in a file or standard input.
  - Count the number of lines, words, and bytes in a file: `wc file.txt`
  - Count the number of lines in multiple files: `wc file1.txt file2.txt`

### `sort`: Sort lines

- Syntax: `sort [options] [file]`
- Usage: The `sort` command is used to sort the contents of a file alphabetically or numerically.
  - Sort the lines of a file alphabetically: `sort file.txt`
  - Sort the lines of a file numerically: `sort -n numbers.txt`

### `uniq`: Unique lines

- Syntax: `uniq [options] [file]`
- Usage: The `uniq` command filters out adjacent duplicate lines from a sorted file or standard input.
  - Remove adjacent duplicate lines from a sorted file: `uniq sorted_file.txt`
  - Remove adjacent duplicate lines from multiple files and display only unique lines:`uniq -u file1.txt file2.txt`

## Examples of Linux Pipes

Let's look at some practical examples of using Linux pipes.

### 1: Combining Commands

Suppose you want to find all files in a directory that contain a specific keyword and then count the number of occurrences of that keyword in each file. You can achieve this with the following pipe:

```bash{ .show-prompt lineNos=false }
grep -lR "keyword" /path/to/directory | xargs wc -l
```

In this example, the `grep` command searches for files that contain the keyword "keyword" recursively in the specified directory. The `-l` option tells `grep` to only display the names of the matching files. The output of `grep` is then passed as input to `xargs`, which converts the file names into arguments for the `wc -l` command. Finally, `wc -l` counts the number of lines for each file.

Similarly, if we want to count the number of lines which contain "error" in them from a file, we can use pipe to select only lines with the keyword using `grep` and then count them using `wc -l`.

```bash{ .show-prompt lineNos=false }
cat server.log | grep "error" | wc -l
```

### 2: Sorting and Filtering Data

Let's say you have a large log file and you want to filter out certain entries and sort them alphabetically. You can achieve this by combining the `grep`, `sort`, and `uniq` commands:

```
cat server.log | grep "error" | sort | uniq
```

In this example, `cat` reads the contents of the log file and passes them as input to `grep`, which filters out only lines containing the word "error". Then, `sort` arranges these filtered lines in alphabetical order, and `uniq` removes any duplicate lines.

## Conclusion

Linux pipes are a fundamental tool for manipulating data on the command line. By connecting commands together with pipes, you can build powerful pipelines that perform complex operations efficiently. With practice, you can become proficient in using Linux pipes and elevate your command line productivity to new heights.
