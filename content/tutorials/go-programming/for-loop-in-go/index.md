In this lesson, we learn about the `for` loop syntax for Golang and how to write for loop in Go.
<!--more-->

Go is very simple and tries to minimize developer errors. For this, Go supports only one kind of loops and that is using `for` keyword. Go does not have `while` or `do...while` loop.

## Syntax of For loop

Go syntax for the `for` loop looks like below.

```go
for initialize; check_condition; post_iteration {
    ... ...
}

for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
    fmt.Println(i)
}
```

Here, we don't need parentheses like we didn't need for `if` condition checks. For loop contains three main items. 
1. Initilization of loop variable: This is where the loop variable gets initialized with start value.
2. Condition: This is the condition which is checked after each iteration. If this condition is `true`, loop gets executed and when this condition becomes `false`, the loop terminates.
3. Post Iteration statements: This is where we modify the loop variable so that this doesn't result in infinite loop.

Let's see an example of for loop.

## For Loop Example

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		fmt.Println(i)
	}
}
```

**Output:**
```output{lineNos=false }
0
1
2
3
4
```


We can also skip any of these statements. For example, in below code, this same `for` loop is working like a `while` loop which produces same result as above.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	i := 0
	for i < 5 {
		fmt.Println(i)
		i++
	}
}
```

If we omit certain statements, that will likely cause **infinite loop**. Below is an example of infinite loop which prints `0` forever.

```go
i := 0
for {
    fmt.Println(i)
}
```

## Continue statement

If we want to skip one of the iteration, we can use the `continue` keyword with a conditional and depending on the result of conditional evaluation, that iteration will be skipped. For example, below code skips iteration when `i` has odd value and hence it prints only even numbers.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	for i := 1; i <= 10; i++ {
		if i%2 != 0 {
			continue
		}
		fmt.Println(i)
	}
}
```

**Output:**
```output{ lineNos=false }
2
4
6
8
10
```

## Break Statement

Similarly, if we want loop to break out pre-maturely when certain condition holds `true`, we can use `break` keyword.
In below code example, the loop `break`s when we encounter first number which is divisible by `5`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	for i := 1; i <= 10; i++ {
		if i%5 == 0 {
			fmt.Println("Breaking out of loop when i is", i)
			break
		}
		fmt.Println(i)
	}
}
```

**Output:**
```output{ lineNos=false }
1
2
3
4
Breaking out of loop when i is 5
```
